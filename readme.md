# Distributional Learning

This repository contains supporting materials for the presentation at the Babycircle Amsterdam in January 2013. Currently it contains a simple implementation of the K-means algorithm and a standard dataset to test it on.

## Prerequisites

This code needs a working python 2.6+ installation plus the numpy, scipy and matplotlib libraries.

## Usage

To generate the plots on k-means, run kmeans_faithful.py.
